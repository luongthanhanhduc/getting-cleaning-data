###### The file "run_analysis.R" provides the script for obtaining the tidy data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set in UCI Machine Learning Repository.

###### In the result tidy data, we have 180 observations with 68 columns. Each column has the the following meaning:
* 1st column is "subject", which means the person who perform experiment. There are totally 30 people performing experiment which unique identifier ranging from 1 to 30.
* 2nd column is "activity", which represents the type of activity in the experiments. There are 6 values corresponding to 6 types of activities performing in the experiments: "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
* From 3rd to 68th columns contains the average values of different measurements for each activity and each subject. A complete details of 66 measurements:

###### In order to achieve the the values of each of these measurements, we have processed the original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set with the following steps:
- Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
